# Compiler

A program consisting of a lexical analyser, a syntax and semantic parser.
This program takes in a text containing C code as input. If there are
syntax or semantic errors, it will flag them as errors and prevent the C code from compiling. Otherwise, it clears the C code to compile as normal
